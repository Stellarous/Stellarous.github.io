I have some general notes on **Formal Sciences** (FS):
FS reffer to an umbrella-term that includes some of the most important fields of studies:
- Mathematics,
- Logic, and
- Theoretical Computer Science.

That's not all the fields that FS includes. There are more to that list:

- Systems Science,
- Cybernetics,
- Data Science,
- Information Theory,
- Network Science and more.

So what's common between these fields of study that sort them under such general term as FS?

The idea lies under the concept of the representation of language. As you know, there are two kinds of languages:
- Natural Languages (NL), and
- Formal Languages (FL).

You might say that NL is developed under a narural process and FL is designed and developed in order to satisfy some specific task. Well, that's also true but it is not exactly what makes FS a FORMAL science.

Another thing that we can think of, is the process of which you make arguments in these fields. Again, there are a subtle difference between Natural Sciences and Formal Sciences, or lets say between NS and FS!

In NS, you mostly use *Induction* as the method of inquery but in FS, you are dealing with *Deductive systems*. A system which is consisted of some basic, assumed to be true *Axioms* or *Assumptions*. Then, using some specific and clear rules, you deduce facts from principles (axioms).

Deduction is in this sense *Formal* that it follows some well-defined and well-orginized **Form**. As you may have noticed, I consisted to use abrriviations instead of complete names of the diciplines I'm talking about. This is some kind of *Formalism* in which, you assign a value to a variable and you use the variable and by doing so, you actually are calling the value or what that variable is reffering to. 

This is called *Formalism*.
